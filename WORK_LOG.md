| April 5      |  9-10pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 24 | 3:15-3:45 | I spent this time coding the Class Storage which is the object I will use to store the list of words for constant time lookups. During this time, I was able to code the initialization as well as methods to set children and check if the inputted word is a string. |
| September 25 | 2:10-2:40 |                                                                 I spent this time completing the implementation involving objects holding arrays of characters. I got the code to work for all cases, but it is not efficient enough to complete bard or rome in time. |
