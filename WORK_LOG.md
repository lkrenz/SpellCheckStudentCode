I eventually ended up with creating a tree of objects that store a list of their children with the children being each possible letter. |

During this time, I was able to code the initialization as well as methods to set children and check if the inputted word is a string. |

I got the code to work for all cases, but it is not efficient enough to complete bard or rome in time. |

I didn't make any progress, but I realized the two parts that are probably slowing down my algorithm are adding the values and then checking them, but I'm still working on a way to speed these steps up. |
| September 26 |        9:00-9:10        | I spent this time going through the code and considering what sections could be sped up. I could be losing some efficiency from the .contains() method I call on my misspelled array, but the extra runtime here is likely minimal, especially because I short circuit that condition the vast majority of the time. I also realized that the problem likely doesn't lie in the section of the code where I load in the dictionary because the same dictionary is loaded in all cases and does not massively impact the runtime in the poem and alice cases. I'm likely loosing the efficiency in the process of actually checking the words. I've started looking through this section for ways to speed it up but will get more done during my next session. |

I looked through both the add word and check word sections of my storage class but I didn't see any redundancies that could be easily removed. I thought of a way to speed up check word that involves a second instance variable that denotes whether a storage element leads to another word, but I realized this is necessary as simply the storage existing denotes that it leads to another word. I spent the rest of the time doing research on Hash maps as a way I could speed up this solution. |

It's kind of crazy little code this takes. After I finished implementing hashtables, I spent the rest trying to figure out how the class worked. It all goes back to a method in the object class that uses something from the location of the object in memory to generate a unique index, but LinkedHashSets somehow add to this by keeping the indices constant while the locations change more in newer operating systems. |

I didn't get too far, but I started to bode the TST class and set up most of Node. |

I specifically spent this time working on the methods for adding words and looking them up. I finished the method for adding words (I don't know if it works yet) and got a good way through coding the method for looking up words) |
