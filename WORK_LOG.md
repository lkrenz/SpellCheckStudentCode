During this time, I was able to code the initialization as well as methods to set children and check if the inputted word is a string. |

I got the code to work for all cases, but it is not efficient enough to complete bard or rome in time. |

I didn't make any progress, but I realized the two parts that are probably slowing down my algorithm are adding the values and then checking them, but I'm still working on a way to speed these steps up. |
| September 26 | 9:00-9:10 | I spent this time going through the code and considering what sections could be sped up. I could be losing some efficiency from the .contains() method I call on my misspelled array, but the extra runtime here is likely minimal, especially because I short circuit that condition the vast majority of the time. I also realized that the problem likely doesn't lie in the section of the code where I load in the dictionary because the same dictionary is loaded in all cases and does not massively impact the runtime in the poem and alice cases. I'm likely loosing the efficiency in the process of actually checking the words. I've started looking through this section for ways to speed it up but will get more done during my next session. |
