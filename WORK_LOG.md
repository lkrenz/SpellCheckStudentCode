I eventually ended up with creating a tree of objects that store a list of their children with the children being each possible letter. |

During this time, I was able to code the initialization as well as methods to set children and check if the inputted word is a string. |

I got the code to work for all cases, but it is not efficient enough to complete bard or rome in time. |

I didn't make any progress, but I realized the two parts that are probably slowing down my algorithm are adding the values and then checking them, but I'm still working on a way to speed these steps up. |
| September 26 |        9:00-9:10        | I spent this time going through the code and considering what sections could be sped up. I could be losing some efficiency from the .contains() method I call on my misspelled array, but the extra runtime here is likely minimal, especially because I short circuit that condition the vast majority of the time. I also realized that the problem likely doesn't lie in the section of the code where I load in the dictionary because the same dictionary is loaded in all cases and does not massively impact the runtime in the poem and alice cases. I'm likely loosing the efficiency in the process of actually checking the words. I've started looking through this section for ways to speed it up but will get more done during my next session. |
| September 27 |      11:25 - 11:55      |                                                                                                                                                                                I spent this time thinking of different ways I could speed up my code. I looked through both the add word and check word sections of my storage class but I didn't see any redundancies that could be easily removed. I thought of a way to speed up check word that involves a second instance variable that denotes whether a storage element leads to another word, but I realized this is necessary as simply the storage existing denotes that it leads to another word. I spent the rest of the time doing research on Hash maps as a way I could speed up this solution. |

It's kind of crazy little code this takes. After I finished implementing hashtables, I spent the rest trying to figure out how the class worked. It all goes back to a method in the object class that uses something from the location of the object in memory to generate a unique index, but LinkedHashSets somehow add to this by keeping the indices constant while the locations change more in newer operating systems. |

I didn't get too far, but I started to bode the TST class and set up most of Node. |

I specifically spent this time working on the methods for adding words and looking them up. I finished the method for adding words (I don't know if it works yet) and got a good way through coding the method for looking up words) |

I got the Trie solution working pretty quickly, but was unable to finish TST within this session. I'm running into an error with my TST where it reaches a null leaf before reaching the end of the word everytime. |

I still think the problem has something to do with checkWord. In my next session, I will add a recursive method to print out the dict TST just to make sure it isn't a problem. |

I realized pretty quickly the method wasn't even adding characters and I've narrowed the problem down to the method overwriting past words as it adds new ones. |

I feel like I made progress, but the code still doesn't work. I narrowed down one problem to the incorrect child be assigned but am now running into an issue where no cnild is assigned. |

I think the issue had something to do with not correctly adding the new nodes onto the TST, but I'm honestly not sure. It really felt like I didn't change anything, just rewrote the code and it worked. I am running into this really annoying issue where my code will autorun when I change files and switch my file to the one with the breakpoint making it really annoying to write code. The issue persists when I don't have breakpoints (but doesn't change file) and I can't figure out why. |

In the process of debugging checkWord, I realized addWord was setting the parent node to true, not the actual node that should be true, so I fixed that. I got checkWord to run, but for some reason it isn't recognizing certain words, I will debug this in my next session. |

I think I have everything pretty much working, but I'm running into an issue with checkWord falsely saying words are in the dictionary. |
